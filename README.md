# Welcome to my profile...

## Working on...

- [AivaptDotNet](https://github.com/MapManagement/AivaptDotNet): A Discord bot which can perform several tasks like playing
music, storing user generated commands and providing information fetched from multiple APIs.
- [Advent of Code 2022](https://github.com/MapManagement/AoC2022): My approach to solve all tasks of 2022. Most solutions
are written in either C#, Python or Rust.

## Updating all the time...

- [gpu-passthrough](https://github.com/MapManagement/gpu-passthrough): Represents a documentation of how to set up GPU
passthrough under Linux while providing multiple helpful tips and tricks.
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/MapManagement/dotfiles): My dotfiles don't only contain all my customizations of my Linux
desktop but also a working Ansible playbook to recreate my machine by only executing a handful of commands.
- [game-servers](https://github.com/MapManagement/game-servers): Some Dockerfiles which contain game servers of smaller and
less resource-intensive (indie) games.

## Already finished...

- un-chat client program (not yet public) and a [server program](https://github.com/MapManagement/un-chat):
These were meant to work as a simple desktop messenger to test the gRPC framework.
- [weisserbot](https://github.com/MapManagement/weisserbot): Also a (Twitch) bot that was used to deliver information in a
Twitch chat in one of my friends' stream.
- [Countdown](https://github.com/MapManagement/Countdown): This one can be seen as a fun project for a good friend. It's an
Android application which either works like a stopwatch or a timer but can be customized in some aspects. Don't expect too
much :D
- [MapApp](https://github.com/MapManagement/MapApp): My first mobile application for Andrdoid devices using Kotlin.
I intented to create an app that helps me to learn vocbularies or some other stuff especially for school.
- [spotify-assistant](https://github.com/MapManagement/spotify-assistant): Resembles somewhat of a CLI for the Spotify Web
API.

## Needs to be maintained...

- [Minion](https://github.com/MapManagement/Minion) and [MinionProcesses](https://github.com/MapManagement/MinionProcesses):
Those are two projects that belong together and were divided into two separate repositories to maintain a better overview.
Minion should be an application with a CLI and GUI to create and modify typical QEMU/KVM guests. It uses the other project,
which provides many common QEMU and libvirt processes packed into C# classes.
- [DoDo](https://github.com/MapManagement/DoDo): Primarily an Android application to write down notes and todos. I also
planned on developing some kind of a [server](https://github.com/MapManagement/DoDo-Server) to synchronize all data from
clients to a centralized storage.

## Contributing to...

- [NeuronalNet](https://github.com/beckluca1/NeuronalNet): I helped a good friend to create a neural network which tries to
recognize pictures of traffic signs. Users can interact with the backend using a web-app written in Blazor.
