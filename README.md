# Welcome to my profile...
No matter how you found my profile, following text will introduce you to my projects and the stuff I already worked with:

## My current projects are...
### [gpu-passthrough](https://github.com/MapManagement/gpu-passthrough)
This repository is about my approach to setup a machine that is able to run multiple operating systems simultaneously (mainly Windows 10 and Linux) without any
big loss of performance in games for example. This can be reached by using virtual machines which can access a dedicated graphics card. If you're already curious
what I'm talking about, simply just click on the link above. Everything important should be explained good enough :)

## DoDo
**[Client](https://github.com/MapManagement/DoDo)**  
DoDo is an Android application which is written in Kotlin and has the main purpose of storing your ToDos and notes you shouldn't forget but certainly would without any
note taking app. The application is still in development and therefore there is no release to test yet.  
**[Server](https://github.com/MapManagement/DoDo-Server)**  
DoDo will also allow you to synychronize your local data with a server. Since the code for the server program is open-source as well, you can easily host the program on
your own machine. The connection is based on gRPC to ensure a safe and stable data transfer between the Kotlin client and the Python server.

## UnChat
UnChat is one of my biggest projects so far. It is more or less a chat platform based on Google's gRPC, C#/WPF and also on Python including a SQL database. The
reason why that many frameworks and languages are part of this project, is following: I created a client (C#/WPF) and a server (Python/SQL) which communicate via gRPC.
Both parts have their own repositoy on my GitHub profile.  
**[Server](https://github.com/MapManagement/un-chat)** | **[Client](https://github.com/MapManagement/un-chat-client)**

## Most experiences with..
- Kotlin, especially with Android applications
- Python in many different sections
- SQL (MySQL and MariaDB)
- C# including the .NET family
- gRPC  

Nonetheless, I would not call my an expert in any of these languages/frameworks/technologies. Therefore I will never stop to learn new stuff, either in my free time or
at work.
