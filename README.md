# Welcome to my profile...

## Working on...
- [AivaptDotNet](https://github.com/MapManagement/AivaptDotNet) is a Discord bot which can perform several tasks like playing
music, storing user generated commands and providing information fetched from multiple APIs.
- [Minion](https://github.com/MapManagement/Minion) and [MinionProcesses](https://github.com/MapManagement/MinionProcesses) are two
projects that belong together and were divided into two separate repositories to maintain a better overview. Minion will 
be an application with a CLI and GUI to create and modify typical QEMU/KVM guests and is based on MinionProcesses. Last one 
provides many common QEMU and libvirt processes packed into C# classes.
- [DoDo](https://github.com/MapManagement/DoDo) is primarily an Android application to write down notes and todos. I also
planned on developing some kind of a [server](https://github.com/MapManagement/DoDo-Server) to synchronize all data from
clients to a centralized storage.

## Updating all the time...
- [gpu-passthrough](https://github.com/MapManagement/gpu-passthrough) isn't any of my coding projects. I created this repo to
track my progress on and write down important steps of passing a whole GPU to a virtual machine under Linux. Somehow it
represents the creation of my current work environment.
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/MapManagement/dotfiles) contains all my customizations of my Linux desktop

## Already finished...
- un-chat contains a client program (not yet public) and a [server programm](https://github.com/MapManagement/un-chat) and
was meant to work as a simple desktop messenger to test the gRPC framework.
- [weisserbot](https://github.com/MapManagement/weisserbot) is also a bot and was used to deliver information in a Twitch chat in one of my friends' stream.
- [Countdown](https://github.com/MapManagement/Countdown) can be seen as a fun project for a good friend. It's an Android
application which either works like a stopwatch or a timer but can be customized in some aspects. Don't expect too much :)
- [mapgame](https://github.com/MapManagement/mapgame) shouldn't be taken too seriously as well. I wanted to test some game
libraries for Python and started to write this little game. Maybe I'll rework it in the future, who knows.
- [MapApp](https://github.com/MapManagement/MapApp) was my first mobile application for Andrdoid devices using Kotlin.
I intented to create an app that helps me to learn vocbularies or some other stuff especially for school.

## Needs to be maintained...
- [spotify-assistant](https://github.com/MapManagement/spotify-assistant) should have been a simple CLI software that allows
me to do some useful things with my Spotify player and/or account by using the official Spotify API.

## Contributing to...
- nothing yet :(
